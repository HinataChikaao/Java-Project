                            HSBC is studying a foreign bid in three months time for PepsiCo, who has built up a
                            portfolio of 10,000 shares in Wahaha, a Chinese nutritional food company.PepsiCo is
                            confident about the future outlook for Wahaha, but also is worried that the price of
                            Wahaha shares will be falling before the bid is launched, and therefore, PepsiCo wishes
                            to avoid the significant loss if this should happen. Intuitively PepsiCo would like to
                            benefit from the price rise of Wahaha. The cost of providing protection against adverse
                            movements in Wahaha prices should be minimized, but with an adequate downside protection.
                            PepsiCo is expecting the stock price of Wahaha will deviate by no more than Â±20% within
                            the next three months.
                            <br/><br/>
                            To provide a best strategy, HSBC would consider the following alternatives:<br/>
                            1.Do nothing.<br/>
                            2.Buy at-the-money puts.<br/>
                            3.Buy at-the-money puts.<br/>
                            4.Buy out-of-the-money puts.<br/>
                            5.Buy in-the-money puts, and sell out-of-the-money puts.<br/>
                            6.Buy out-of-the-money puts, and sell out-of-the money calls.<br/>
                            7.Any other strategies that you can devise.<br/>
                            <br/><br/>
                            REQUIRED:<br/>
                            Use OSA to examine all possible alternatives. Consider carefully the advantages
                            and disadvantages of each one, looking at:<br/><br/>
                            net option premiums paid<br/>
                            level of losses that can be sustained<br/>
                            opportunities to profit should Wahaha shares rise<br/>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Finally, taking into account PepsiCoâ€™s objective, select the strategy that HSBC
                            would recommend to Pepsi.

                            Once a trader determines to enter the options market, they must decide which strategy to
                            take to ensure his/her success in the current market. Recall that the option payoff profiles
                            from buying and selling call and put options, and from long and short positions in an
                            underlying asset, look like this: (with these, a wide variety of strategies can be built)

                            of 10,000 shares. Write out the list of options that the fund manager should buy
