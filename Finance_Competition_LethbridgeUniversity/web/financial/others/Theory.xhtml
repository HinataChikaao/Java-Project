                            <br/><br/>
                            Option- A financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party to another
                            party. The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call)
                            or sell (put) a security or other financial assets (underlying) at an agreed-upon price
                            (strike price) during a certain time period (time to expiration) or on a specific date
                            (expiration date).
                            <br/><br/>
                            A call option gives the option holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a
                            certain specified date for a specified price.
                            <br/><br/>
                            A put option gives the option holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a
                            selected date for a pre-selected price.

                            Black and Scholes In 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes published their groundbreaking
                            paper the pricing of options and corporate liabilities. Not only did this specify the
                            first successful options pricing formula, but it also described a general framework
                            for pricing other derivative instruments. That paper launched the field of financial
                            engineering.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The Black-Scholes (1973) option pricing formula prices European put or call options on
                            a stock that does not pay a dividend or make other distributions. The formula assumes
                            the underlying stock price follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant volatility.

                            We should first understand the factors which influence the change in the price of an
                            option. Then we can better understand how this fits in with the Option Greeks.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The 5 Option Greeks measure the sensitivity of the price of stock options in relation
                            to 4 different factors; Changes in the underlying stock price, interest rate,
                            volatility and time decay.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Option Greeks allow option traders to objectively calculate changes in the value of
                            the option contracts in their portfolio with changes in the factors that affects the
                            value of stock options. The ability to mathematically calculate these changes gives
                            option traders the ability to hedge their portfolio or to construct positions with
                            specific risk/reward profiles.

                            <strong>BINOMIAL TREE</strong>
                            <br/><br/>
                            The binomial lethbridge.model breaks down the time to expiration into potentially a very
                            large number of time intervals, or steps. A tree of stock prices is initially
                            produced working forward from the present to expiration. At each step it is assumed
                            that the stock price will move up or down by an amount calculated using volatility and
                            time to expiration. This produces a binomial distribution, or recombining tree, of
                            underlying stock prices. The tree represents all the possible paths that the stock
                            price could take during the life of the option.
                            <br/><br/>
                            At the end of the tree, which is at expiration of the option, all the terminal option
                            prices for each of the final possible stock prices are known as they simply equal
                            their intrinsic values.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Next the option prices at each step of the tree are calculated working back from
                            expiration to the present. The option prices at each step are used to derive the
                            option prices at the next step of the tree using risk neutral valuation based on the
                            probabilities of the stock prices moving up or down, the risk free rate and the time
                            interval of each step. Any adjustments to stock prices at an ex-dividend date or
                            option prices as a result of early exercise of american options are worked into the
                            calculations at the required point in time. At the top of the tree you are left with
                            one option price.
